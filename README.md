# SizzylTF2
This is everything I use in TF2 that isn't [my custom hud](https://github.com/Sizzyl/SizzylHUD) that I'm allowed to put here by mod creators
(some mod creators don't allow people to redistribute their stuff and those mods will be listed further down in the READMe).
Luckily as of writing this, I'm allowed to redistribute all the modss here, but it's worth noting that the larger mod files will only be downloadable via the releases tab.

## Install / Use
Update when finished.

## WARNINGS
1. Things might not work without the exact launch options I use.
Here are my launch options (for 1080p display, if you have a different resolution, change the w and h values,
if you don't want to play borderless windowed remove ```-windowed -noborder -w 1920 -h 1080``` entirely):

```-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -particles 1 -precachefontchars -windowed -noborder -w 1920 -h 1080 +exec preloader```

2. Mods with files included in this repo might not have proper settings for your system OR be fully up to date. They are simply what I personally use. It is heavily reccomended to download each mod individually from their page listed below.

3. This is also not optimized for any system other than my own. It is likely better to pick and choose what mods/quality levels you'd like to use invidually, especially if you're on a lower end system.
