As I only created the autoexec.cfg file in this repository myself, only that file is under [the same liscence](https://github.com/Sizzyl/SizzylHUD/blob/main/LISCENSE) 
as my custom TF2 HUD which allows free use as long as the project it is used in is also open source and uses the same open source liscence.
Every other included file in this repository is ONLY allowed for download and use with 
the video game Team Fortress 2 made by Valve downloaded from [this link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/),
and cannot be redistributed, modified, sold, or anything that isn't explicitely using the file for use within 
the custom folder in Team Fortress 2 installed from its official storefront unless specified otherwise on any individual mod's page.
